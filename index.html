    <p>The Premier League, also known as the English Premier League or the EPL (legal name: The Football Association
        Premier League Limited), is the top level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it
        operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons typically run
        from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all 19 other teams both home and away).<sub><a
                href="#">[1]</a></sub> Most
        games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.<sub><a href="#">[3]</a></sub>
    </p>
    <p>The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the
        Football League First Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of a
        lucrative television rights sale to Sky.<sub><a href="#">[3]</a></sub> From 2019 to 2020, the league's
        accumulated television rights deals
        were worth around £3.1 billion a year, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and
        32 games respectively.<sub><a href="#">[4]</a></sub><sub><a href="#">[5]</a></sub> The Premier League is a
        corporation where chief executive Richard Masters is
        responsible for its management, whilst the member clubs act as shareholders.<sub><a href="#">[6]</a></sub> Clubs
        were apportioned central
        payment revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17, with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to English
        Football League (EFL) clubs.<sub><a href="#">[7]</a></sub>
    </p>
    <p>The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million
        homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.[8][9] For the 2018–19 season, the average Premier
        League match attendance was at 38,181,[10] second to the German Bundesliga's 43,500,[11] while aggregated
        attendance across all matches is the highest of any association football league at 14,508,981.[12] Most stadium
        occupancies are near capacity.<sub><a href="#">[16]</a></sub> The Premier League ranks first in the UEFA
        coefficients of leagues based on
        performances in European competitions over the past five seasons as of 2021.[14] The English top-flight has
        produced the second-highest number of UEFA Champions League/European Cup titles, with five English clubs having
        won fourteen European trophies in total.<sub><a href="#">[15]</a></sub>
        Fifty clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992: forty-eight English and two Welsh
        clubs. Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Chelsea (5), Manchester City (5), Arsenal (3),
        Blackburn Rovers (1),<a href="#">Leicester City </a> (1) and <a href="#">Liverpool</a> (1).<sub><a

    <h1>History [<a href="#">edit</a>]
    </h1>
    <h3>Origin[<a href="#">edit</a>]</h3>
    <p>Despite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late 1980s marked a low point for English
        football. Stadiums were crumbling, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs
        had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.<sub><a href="#">[17]</a></sub>  The
        Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's
        Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendances and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.<sub><a href="#">[18]</a></sub> 

        </b>
        By the turn of the 1990s, the downward trend was starting to reverse. At the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England
        reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs
        playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in
        1991. The Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater
        stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, was published in January 1990.<sub><a href="#">[21]</a></sub> 
        </b>
        During the 1980s, major English clubs had begun to transform into business ventures, applying commercial
        principles to club administration to maximise revenue. Martin Edwards of Manchester United, Irving Scholar of
        Tottenham Hotspur, and David Dein of Arsenal were among the leaders in this transformation.[<sub><a href="#">[20]</a></sub>  The commercial
        imperative led to the top clubs seeking to increase their power and revenue: the clubs in Division One
        threatened to break away from the Football League, and in so doing they managed to increase their voting power
        and gain a more favourable financial arrangement, taking a 50% share of all television and sponsorship income in
        1986.<sub><a href="#">[21]</a></sub> They demanded that television companies should pay more for their coverage of football matches,<sub><a href="#">[21]</a></sub> 
        and revenue from television grew in importance. The Football League received £6.3 million for a two-year
        agreement in 1986, but by 1988, in a deal agreed with ITV, the price rose to £44 million over four years with
        the leading clubs taking 75% of the cash.<sub><a href="#">[22]</a></sub> <sub><a href="#">[23]</a></sub> According to Scholar, who was involved in the negotiations of
        television deals, each of the First Division clubs received only around £25,000 per year from television rights
        before 1986, this increased to around £50,000 in the 1986 negotiation, then to £600,000 in 1988.<sub><a href="#">[24]</a></sub>  The 1988
        negotiations were conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a "super league", but they were
        eventually persuaded to stay, with the top clubs taking the lion's share of the deal.<sub><a href="#">[22]</a></sub> <sub><a href="#">[25]</a></sub>  <sub><a href="#">[26]</a></sub> The
        negotiations also convinced the bigger clubs that in order to receive enough votes, they needed to take the
        whole of First Division with them instead of a smaller "super league".<sub><a href="#">[27]</a></sub>  By the beginning of the 1990s, the
        big clubs again considered breaking away, especially now that they had to fund the cost of stadium upgrade as
        proposed by the Taylor Report.<sub><a href="#">[28]</a></sub> 
        In 1990, the managing director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with the representatives of
        the "big five" football clubs in England (Manchester United,<a href="#">Liverpool</a>,<a href="#"> Tottenham Hotspur</a>, <a href="#">Everton</a> and <a href="#">Arsenal</a>)
        over a dinner.<sub><a href="#">[29]</a></sub>  The meeting was to pave the way for a breakaway from The Football League.<sub><a href="#">[30]</a></sub>  Dyke believed
        that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national
        television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights
        money.<sub><a href="#">[31]</a></sub>  The five clubs agreed with the suggestion and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league
        would have no credibility without the backing of The Football Association, and so David Dein of Arsenal held
        talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not enjoy an amicable relationship with the
        Football League at the time and considered it as a way to weaken the Football League's position.<sub><a href="#">[23]</a></sub>  The FA
        released a report in June 1991, Blueprint for the Future of Football, that supported the plan for Premier League
        with FA the ultimate authority that would oversee the breakaway league.<sub><a href="#">[27]</a></sub> 
    </p>

    <h3>Foundation (1990s)[<a href="#">edit</a>]</h3>
    <p> See also:
        <a href="#">Foundation of the Premier League</a></p>

    <p>At the close of the 1990–1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would
        bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's
        top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.<sub><a href="#">[33]</a></sub>  The newly formed
        top division was to have commercial independence from The Football Association and the Football League, giving
        the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at
        the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe.<sub><a href="#">[18]</a></sub>  Although
        Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, he and ITV (of which LWT was part) lost
        out in the bidding for broadcast rights: BSkyB won with a bid of £304 million over five years, with the BBC
        awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.<sub><a href="#">[29]</a></sub> <sub><a href="#">[31]</a></sub> 
        The First Division clubs resigned en masse from the Football League in 1992, and on 27 May that year the FA
        Premier League was formed as a limited company, working out of an office at the Football Association's then
        headquarters in Lancaster Gate.<sub><a href="#">[18]</a></sub>  The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were:<sub><a href="#">[32]</a></sub>

    <p>This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the
        Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in
        competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between
        the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and <a href="#"> Second
            Divisions</a> with three
        teams relegated from the league and three promoted.[26]
    </p>
    <div>The league held its first season in 1992–93. It was composed of 22 clubs for that season (reduced to 20 in the
        1995–96 season). The first Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of <a href="#">Sheffield United</a> in
        a 2–1 win
        against <a href="#">Manchester United</a>.[35] Luton Town, Notts County, and West Ham United were the three
        teams relegated from
        the old First Division at the end of the 1991–92 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League
        season.[36]

    <p>The years following 2009 marked a shift in the structure of the "Top Four" with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester
        City both breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the "Top Four" into the "Big
        Six".<sub><a href="#">[46]</a></sub>
        In the 2009–10 season, Tottenham finished fourth and became the first team to break the top four since Everton
        five years prior.<sub><a href="#">[47]</a></sub>Criticism of the gap between an elite group of "super clubs" and
        the majority of the
        Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier
        League clubs.[48] Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season, becoming the first club outside the "Big
        Four" to win since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season. That season also saw two of the "Big Four" (Chelsea
        and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season. <sub><a
